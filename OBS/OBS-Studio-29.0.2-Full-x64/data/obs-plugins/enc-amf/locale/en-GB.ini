RateControlMethod.Description="What method should be used to control the (bit)rate?\n- '\@RateControlMethod.CQP\@' assigns fixed quantisation parameters to each frame and is recommended for high quality to near lossless recording.\n- '\@RateControlMethod.CBR\@' attempts to get as close as possible to the \@Bitrate.Target\@, optionally filling it with \@FillerData\@, and is recommended for streaming.\n- '\@RateControlMethod.VBR\@' attempts to get as close as possible to the \@Bitrate.Peak\@ and if possible goes as low as the \@Bitrate.Target\@, and is recommended for small size recording.\n- '\@RateControlMethod.VBRLAT\@' is similar to '\@RateControlMethod.VBR\@' but instead takes into account encoding latency."
VBAQ.Description="Enable the use of 'Variance Based Adaptive Quantisation' (VBAQ) which is based on pixel variance to distribute bitrate better.\nIt works on the idea that the human visual system is less sensitive to artifacts in highly textured areas and thus will push the bitrate towards smoother surfaces.\nEnabling this may lead to improvements in subjective quality with certain content."
View.Description="Which properties should be visible?\n- '\@View.Basic\@' is the most basic view and recommended for everyone.\n- '\@View.Advanced\@' shows more options like multi-GPU support and is recommended for advanced users.\n- '\@View.Expert\@' shows dangerous options that have the potential to cause serious problems and is only recommended if you truly know what you are doing.\n- '\@View.Master\@' removes all viewing restrictions and shows all options including ones that can cause hardware defects.\n\nOBS and the plug-in maintainers are not responsible for any damages resulting from your actions, as per license agreement. Using '\@View.Master\@' disqualifies you from any kind of support for any issues that may arise."
